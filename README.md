This was a homework assignment given by the Web Design professor. The task was to develop a menu for a restaurant, but all the data of the meals must be in a JSON format file. To fulfill this requirement, I decided to recreate the Krusty Krab menu from the SpongeBob SquarePants series, with all of the images sourced from the corresponding section on the fandom.com website.
